The industry I have in mind for this is Logistics. I feel it's a naturally eventful domain, ill-suited to databases that only store the current state of the world. It's also an industry where connectivity can be a challenge; warehouses and distribution centers are one thing, but what about capturing data on the road, at the farm gate, or out at sea? You want to be able to record events always, not just when the internet is working.

Logistics also has quite terrible software, so that helps a lot.
